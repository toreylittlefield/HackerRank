Problem 1:  Conditional Probability
Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-4/problem
Tutorial: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-4/tutorial

Objective
In this challenge, we get started with conditional probability. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!

Task
Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

Answer: 1/3

Editorial: Possible Combinations of child set = {[BB, GG, BG]}, there are 3 possibilities therefore there is a 1/3 chance that the pair BB occurs

Problem 2:  Cards of the Same Suit
Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-5/problem
Tutorial: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-5/tutorial

Objective
In this challenge, we're getting started with combinations and permutations. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!

Task
You draw 2 cards from a standard -card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

Answer: 12/51

Editorial: Shortcut explaination is we only care about the 2nd event (independent events) therefore if the deck has only 12 cards of the target suit
and only 51 total cards now, then the answer is simply 12/51

Problem 3: Drawing Marbles
Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-6/problem
Objective
In this challenge, we're reinforcing what we've learned today. In case you've missed them, today's tutorials are on Conditional Probability and Combinations and Permutations.


Task
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

Answer: 2/3

Editorial: Without making it complicated we can use the same logic as above in Problem 2. We now have a bag with 2 red and 4 blue marbles. Theres 6 total marbles.
So therefore 4(blue)/6(total) = 2/3 chance
