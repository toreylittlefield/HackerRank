// There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.


// Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
// Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
// Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

// One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

// Example 1: Expect ~33.33
