/**
Task:
The probability that a machine produces a defective product is 1/3.
What is the probability that the 1st defect occurs the 5th item produced?

Input Format:
The first line contains the respective space-separated numerator and denominator for the probability of a defect, 
and the second line contains the inspection we want the probability of being the first defect for:
    1 3
    5

If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

Output Format

Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places.

    //Enter your code here
}
