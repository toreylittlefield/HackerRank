* Name: Arrays: Left Rotation
*
* -----------
* Description
* -----------
* A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left.
* For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1,2,3,4,5], then the array would become [3,4,5,1,2].
* Note that the lowest index item moves to the highest index in a rotation. This is called a circular array.
*
* Given an array a of n integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array.
* Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.
*
